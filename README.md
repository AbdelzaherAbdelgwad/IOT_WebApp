# This website was developed as part of a graduation project for an IoT security system 

- It provides a comprehensive platform for security teams to monitor IoT networks in sensitive environments like banks, hospitals, companies, and
smart homes. The system detects intruders and logs their activities in real-time, offering detailed reports for analysis.
- Directives like ngIf and ngFor were used to conditionally display security logs and intruder reports dynamically based
on real-time data. Forms and validation ensured secure and correct data input for login, system configuration, and
reporting modules. Two-way data binding implemented to synchronize the UI with security data, allowing real-time
updates to be displayed as threats were detected.
- Additionally, TypeScript was utilized to enforce type safety and structure, improving code reliability and
maintainability across the platform.
